Project Title: Predicting the mortality rate of ICU patients (May-Oct 2022)

Overview: The goal of this project is to develop a standalone program that can
be used to predict mortality rates based on data of ICU patients obtained from
the PhysioNet Computing in Cardio Challenge 2012. There are over 40
variables to consider, and machine learning must be used to process the data
from patients for deriving a data analytical model. Additionally, it was also
undertaken as a three-person team. Finally, this project was executed using an
agile project management methodology, and its progress was tracked through
weekly meetings in the form of minutes meetings as well as a Kanban board.

My Role:
- Implement a neural network model in Python, that can process data
obtained from the PhysioNet website and compute a prediction output
(number between 0 and 1).
- Present an interpretable model to go with the neural network to display
which variables were responsible for skewing the results.
Blackbox testing for the models.

Outcomes:
- A deep neural-network was implemented using the TensorFlow library in
Python.
- An interpretable model was implemented using the SHAP library in
Python.
- The overall prediction had an accuracy of approximately 80-85%
