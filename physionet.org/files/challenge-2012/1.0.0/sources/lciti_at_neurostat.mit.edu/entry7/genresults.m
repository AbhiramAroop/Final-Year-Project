% MATLAB script for processing a Challenge 2012 data set with a Challenge entry
% Version 2.0  (22 March 2012)
%
% A script similar to this one will be used as part of the evaluation of
% Challenge entries written in m-code.  A companion script will be used to
% perform the same function for Challenge entries written in C and other
% languages.  We have provided these scripts so that Challenge participants
% can test their entries to verify that they run properly in the environment
% that will be used to test them.
%
% Each Challenge .txt file (record) contains data for one patient, in 3 columns
% (timestamp, parameter, and value).  The three Challenge data sets contain
% 4000 records each.
%
% This script supplies a complete set of 4000 records, one at a time, to an
% entry, and collects its output for each record (a binary prediction of
% survival, for event 1, and an estimate of mortality risk, for event 2)
% in a summary output file.
%
% The summary output file is then scored by comparing its contents with the
% patients' known outcomes.  This script includes MATLAB code that can
% calculate unofficial scores for the training data (set A), for which the
% known outcomes are provided to participants.  Entries will be ranked using
% official scores obtained using the same methods, but based on testing with
% sets B and C, for which the outcomes are not provided to participants.
%
% If your entry is written in m-code, it must be in the form of a function
% named physionet2012, with this signature:
%     [risk,survival]=physionet2012(tm,category,val);
% See the sample entry at http://physionet.org/challenge/2012/physionet2012.m
% for descriptions of the input and output variables.
%
% To use this script to obtain an unofficial score for your entry on set A:
%  1. Download these files from http://physionet.org/challenge/2012/ and save
%     them in your MATLAB working directory:
%	genresults.m		   (this file)
%	lemeshow.m		   (function needed to calculate Event 2 score)
%	set-a.zip or set-a.tar.gz  (zip archive or tarball of set A files)
%	Outcomes-a.txt		   (known outcomes for set A)
%  2. Unzip set-a.zip (or unpack set-a.tar.gz), creating a subdirectory within
%	your working directory called 'set-a'.  When you have completed this
%	step, the set-a directory should contain 4000 individual .txt files.
%  3. Save a copy of your entry (physionet2012.m) in your working directory.
%  4. The next few lines are MATLAB code that clears any previously set
%     variables, and sets the name of the directory containing the input
%     data, the name for the summary output file, and the name of the file
%     containing the known outcomes.  Change them if necessary.

        clearvars;close all;clc
        data_root = '/_space_/Temp/CinC/';
        set_name='set-a6';
	fname_out='Outputs-a.txt';
	results='/_space_/Temp/CinC/Outcomes-a.txt';

%  5. Start MATLAB and type
%       Main_Challenge
%     The fname_out file will be generated in the
%     current directory.
%
% You can also use this script to run your entry on test set B, but it will
% not be able to calculate scores in this case, since the outcomes are provided
% for set A only.  To do this, download and unzip/unpack set B into a 'set-b'
% subdirectory as you did for set A, and uncomment the next three lines:
%
       set_name='set-b';
       fname_out='Outputs-b.txt'
       results=[];
%
% Note that if you run a test on either set A or B more than once, you should
% delete (or rename) your summary output file (named in fname_out), since this
% code appends new outputs to any existing output file rather than starting
% over.
